# Analog and Digital Sensors
Analog sensors are those that turn their sensed data into an analog signal. on the other hand, digital signals are those that generate a digital signal in response to the input they receive which mean 0 and 1 or HIGH and LOW.

## Analog Sensor
using photoresistor as an analog sensor with Arduino Uno board

### Requirements
Using [Tinkerkad](www.tinkercad.com)
*  Arduino Uno R3 board
* Solderless Breadboard
* Photoresistor 
* Jumper Wires
* LED
* Resistors (220Ω-10kΩ)


## Digital Sensor
using IR sensor as a digital sensor with Arduino Uno board and use IR remote to turn on and turn off the led that connected to the digitial I/O pin 13

### Requirements
Using [Tinkerkad](www.tinkercad.com)
*  Arduino Uno R3 board
* IR sensor
* Jumper Wires
* IR remote

#### Arduino Remote
HEX code for IR Remote in the code we use two buttons, which are 0 refers to low and 1 refers to high.
